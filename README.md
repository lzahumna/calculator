# Calculator

Decided to play with calculator implementation on Java. 
The repo consists of two calculator implementations : simple and stack-based one

Simple impl supports the following operations :
+ add
+ subtract
+ multiply
+ divide
+ log
+ power
+ exp

... and doesn't support parentheses

Stack-based impl supports the following operations :  
+ add
+ subtract
+ multiply
+ divide

... and supports  parentheses

### Prerequisites

- Java 8
- Maven

### Running the tests

Clone the project and open in IDE. 

For simple impl, find EntryPoint, look through the code and run it to check how it works
For stack-based impl, find StackCalculator, look through the code and run it to check how it works. Note : there is a sample commented out to give some intuition what you should type to make it working.
